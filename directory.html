        <p><h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" title="link"> Why Disability Mainstreaming is Good for Business: A New Narrative.</a></h1> 
            <h2>Sanjutka Choudhury Kaul, Quamrul Alam, & Manjit Singh Sandhu; Published by Journal of Business Ethics</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>This is a journal article that has been published by the Journal of Business Ethics</li>
            <li>The authors are all professors in the realm of Business except for Manjit Singh Sandhu, with Kaul teaching Business Ethics, Alam teaching Internal Business & Strategy, and Sandhu working in Business Development as a Quality Assurance Manager, so they have plenty of knowledgeable on the business aspect, but unsure if they’re as knowledgeable on disability itself.</li>
            <l>The authors provide a different perspective since they discuss the economy in India, which is much different than the economy in America.</li>
            <li>The main takeaway from the article is that voluntarily mainstreaming disability has been the main way to push such an agenda. With other factors helping to promote this engagement, there seems to be more work done towards integrating minority employees such as people with disabilities.</li></p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Melinda Knight & Sushil K Oswal; Published by Association for Business Communication</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>This is a journal article published by the Association for Business Communication</li>
            <li>The authors both teach at their respective universities. Melissa Knight specializes in American Studies and is interested in intersectionality in American literature, while Sushil Oswal teaches in a Disability Studies program and does research on inclusion in employment of technology. I would say with these backgrounds that the authors are very knowledgeable in the topic they present.</li>
            <li>With their backgrounds, I would say that the authors do have a perspective that is different in that it does not really include personal experience but could include some bias since they are very specialized in the area.</li>
            <li>This journal article mainly presents research from articles that shows the accessibility levels of some websites and how to create equal access for those with disabilities.</li></p>

            <h2>Herzing Staff; Published by Herzing University</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>This source is an article published on the Herzing University website</li>
            <li>The author is the Herzing staff but does not specify which staff. This makes it difficult to know the level of expertise from the authors.</li>
            <li>The article is about promoting disability awareness, and by seeing how the university website has a tab for accessibility options for various disabilities, I would say that they are large advocates for promoting disability awareness which shows in the article.</li>
            <li>The takeaway from this article is that there are many ways to promote disability in the workplace, but it mainly starts modeling pro-awareness behavior and using resources to promote events that can have your message sent.</li></p>

            <h2>Deepa Shivaram; Published by National Public Radio (NPR)</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>This source is a news article from National Public Radio</li>
            <li>The author is a political reporter on breaking news, which means she may not be an expert on the topic but is an expert at finding the information needed from external sources.</li>
            <li>In the article, while they discuss underrepresentation in workforce, the author made sure to add how the current leaders are making progress, which could be bias since this reporter followed Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2020 elections and again once she was tapped as Vice President.</li>
            <li>The main takeaway from the article was that people with disabilities feel specifically underrepresented in the federal workforce and showcases personal experiences of individuals with disabilities and the barriers they faced while working under some branch of the federal government.</li></p>

            <li>Andrew Pulrang is a freelance writer with lifelong disabilities and 22 years of experience as a service provider and executive in nonprofit disability services and advocacy. Andrew is bias towards disabled people considering he identifies as disabled himself.</li>  
            <li>The main takeaway from the article is that making your business more welcoming and accessible will highly benefit your business and the disabled community.</li></p>

            <li>The main takeaway from the article is creating a business and workplace that is compatible with disabled people. It also talks a lot about the benefits of disability disclosure and how it benefits the company.</li></p>

            <ul>
            <li>This source is a blog post on a website called BetterUp.</li>
            <li>The author is a psychologist that specializes in wellness and life coaching.</li>
            <li>The author discusses ideas surrounding the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace not just because they add diversity but also because they are humans who have skills and things to offer a company.</li>
            <li>I think the author provides an interesting perspective on workplace relations and how many people only notice employees with disabilities as a sort of a diversity hire instead of the skills they have to offer.</li></p>

            <li>The author of this article is the founder and director of The Valuable 500. The Valuable 500 is a global business collective of 500 companies that innovate together for disability inclusion.</li>
            <li>I think the author provides a very interesting perspective because she herself is a person who has a disability and is a sort of social entrepreneur that advocates for inclusion for people with disabilities in business.</li>
            <li>In the article the author describes her sort of life story with struggling with disability and accepting who she was. She then goes on to describe why its so important that people with disabilities are given the opportunity to show what they can do rather than just being hired as diversity hires.</li></p>

            <ul>
            <li>This source is an article from Time magazine.</li>
            <li>The authors of this article are experts in their fields of diversity and inclusion in business. Polman is chair and Parker is chief innovation officer of the Valuable 500, a business network supporting diversity inclusion.</li>
            <li>I think that both of these authors provide a good perspective on people with disabilities in business and how there is a shortage of awareness on the issue of people with disabilities being kept out of the business arena.</li>
            <li>The biggest thing that I took away from this article was how a lot of diversity, equity, and inclusion in business often forgets or leaves behind people with disabilities and instead focuses more on other forms of diversity in gender, race, and sexuality. The article then goes on to a sort of call to action for business leaders to recognize this issue and bias.</li></p>

            <h2>The National Diversity Council and Published by Columbia University</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>This source is an article written by the National Diversity Council (NDC) and published and presented by Columbia University.</li>
            <li>The authors for this article (I am sure there is more than one) provide a very business-oriented perspective on hiring people with disabilities and why it is not just a point to diversify your employment, but also beneficial to the company by having a different perspective and skillset of employee.</li>
            <li>Also, I liked how this article, unlike the others, it focuses on the pure business aspect of including people with disabilities in business and not as much on the social issues and challenges that people with disabilities face in the workplace. Not that the social issues aren’t important but the focus on the business side of things speaks more directly to business leaders.</li>
            <li>Overall, this article uses reason to explain how hiring people with disabilities is not so different from hiring other qualified individuals. It explains that people with disabilities can provide just as a diverse range of skills as non-disabled people, if not more.</li></p>
